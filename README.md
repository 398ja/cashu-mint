# cashu-mint

cashu-mint is a Java implementation of the [Cashu protocol](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts) providing a core library and REST API for running a mint.

The mint now exposes a shared `SignatureVaultService` bean so that signatures minted in one request can be restored in a later request. When calling protocol methods such as `NUT04.mint` or `NUT09.restore` directly, pass the `SignatureVaultService` instance to ensure signatures persist across calls.
